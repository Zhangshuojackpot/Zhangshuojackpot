### Greetings everyone! This is Shuo Zhang👋
🏫 My status: I am currently working as a full-time DPhil student at SHElab, Southeast University, China. I major in biomedical engineering and try to use some data-driven algorithms to solve real-world healthcare problems, and I am graduating soon!

🔭 My interests: Generally speaking, my research can be divided into two stages. On the one hand, I attempt to make some contributions to the data-driven algorithms themselves. Some common bottlenecks in deep learning have been focused on and improved in my research, such as learning with noisy labels. On the other hand, I make some efforts to adjust state-of-the-art methods in deep learning to improve some healthcare problems, especially in physiological signal monitoring.

❓ You are very welcomed to contact me regarding research-wise collaboration or working/study chance and experience.
